  FAVE MUSICIAN</h2>
<body>
  <p> <strong>my favorite band is  </strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park" target="_blank">Linkin Park</a></p>
  <p>  It was the first time I listened to their songs when I was in junior high school. I like very powerful rock and roll.</p>
<h2>A Brief Bio</h2>
  <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while they later transitioned into more electronica- and pop-influenced music.</p>
